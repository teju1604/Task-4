As a part of my Internship, I've devloped 3 tasks which are as follows :

**Task 1: TO-DO-LIST :**
                  
                  
                  A To-Do-List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This task aims to create a GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.


**Task 2: CALCULATOR :**


                  This task is a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. It will prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice. It performs the calculation and displays the result. 


**Task 3: ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME :**


                  This is a simple rock-paper-scissor game in which it prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors. Then it will generate a random choice(rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer. It determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. It also displays the result whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie. It keeps a track of the user's and computer's scores for multiple rounds. It will also ask the user if they want to play another round.
